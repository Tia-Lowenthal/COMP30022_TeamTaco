### Hoh Family Artifact Register ###

The Hoh Family Artifact Register is a web app which catalogues the Hoh Family's artifacts.

Its features include:
* Registering family members securely using encrypted passwords
* A signing in interface with authentication
* An upload page which provides the ability of populating only the desired fields
* The ability to create user defined tags for increased customisation
* A search page which enables the user to perform a text based search based on a variety of item fields as well as filtering based on tags, categories and price ranges


### Running the Project ###

Note: the website doesn't function properly as we have deleted the database which supported it.

In order to run the project locally, clone the repository and run `npm run dev`. The project will run on localhost:5000 (backend sever) and localhost:3000 (frontend server).

You can access the deployed website [here](http://radiant-dusk-39702.herokuapp.com).
